**Melek H. Eroglu** "The Breadth and Depth of Negative Partisanship in European Multiparty Systems"
<details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
How broad and deep are individuals' aversions to opposing political parties? Although negative partisanship (NP) has recently become a highly salient topic, existing measures fall short as they fail to account for the intensity of an individual's dislike nor the number of disliked parties. This paper introduces a novel approach to measuring NP which overcomes these limitations. Using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) across 31 multiparty systems, I compare the relationship between new and old NP measures on democratic attitudes, support for extremism, and political participation. The findings reveal that the new NP measures go beyond the old measures in explaining adverse consequences of NP on democracies, such as increased dissatisfaction and support for extremist parties, and also show stronger correlations with affective and ideological polarization. This research underscores the urgent need to develop strategies to mitigate NP and its detrimental impacts on democratic systems.

**Melek H. Eroglu**, Steven E. Finkel, Anja Neundorf, Aykut Öztürk, and Ericka Rascón Ramírez "Choosing Democracy Over Party? How Civic Education Can Mitigate the Anti-Democratic Effects of Partisan Polarization"
<details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
How can the negative effects of partisan polarization on democratic attitudes be mitigated? Can polarized individuals be persuaded to choose democracy over party, i.e., support a candidate from an opposing party who upholds democratic norms when their co-partisan candidate fails to do so? We tested the effect of an online civic education intervention conducted on over 41,000 individuals in 33 countries that was designed to promote the choice for “democracy” by emphasizing the benefits of democratic versus autocratic regimes. The results are striking: exposure to civic education messages significantly dampens the negative effect of partisan polarization on anti-democratic co-partisan candidate choice. Civic education also has a small positive effect on polarization itself, with further exploration showing that this is the result of increased evaluations of parties that uphold democratic norms and practices, resulting in greater differences between democratic and antidemocratic parties.
