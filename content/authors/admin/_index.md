I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Political Science at Aarhus University, working on the [ADDEM](https://suthan.dk/min-side/) Project. In this project, we design and test pro-democracy advertisements to examine whether they can meaningfully strengthen citizens’ democratic commitments.

My broader research focuses on affective polarization, out-party hostility, democratic attitudes, and experimental methods to understand how citizens respond to political and democratic challenges. Before joining Aarhus, I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. My dissertation, *Three Essays on Partisan Hostility and Democratic Political Behavior* explores 1) how to measure hostility toward multiple out-parties in multi-party democracies, which has been published in the *Electoral Studies*, 2) the implications of such hostility for citizens’ voting behavior and democratic attitudes; and 3) ways to reduce high levels of hostility through a survey experiment in Germany that examines the impact of alternative frames of pro-democracy messages. 

The second branch of my research examines the intersection of civic education and polarization. In a co-authored paper in which I was the first author under the ERC-funded project [DEMED](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/democracyresearch/) (Democracy under Threat: How Education can Save it), published in the *British Journal of Political Science*, we investigate how online civic education can mitigate the anti-democratic effects of partisan polarization. We collect original data from 33 countries with a total of 41,000 participants.
