I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at University of Pittsburgh and an Andrew W. Mellon Predoctoral Fellow for the 2024-2025 academic year. My research examines the intersection between affective polarization, out-party hostility, democratic attitudes, voting behavior, and civic education.

Over the last two decades, a dramatic increase in individuals’ hostility toward opposing political parties in many democracies has put these countries on a dangerous trajectory. As hostility intensifies, it is anticipated to contribute to the rise of radicalism and political violence. Thus, in the first branch of my research-my dissertation- I explore 1) how to measure hostility toward multiple out-parties in multi-party democracies, which has been revised and resubmitted to the *Electoral Studies*, 2) the implications of such hostility for citizens’ voting behavior and democratic attitudes; and 3) ways to reduce high levels of hostility through a survey experiment in Germany that examines the impact of policy and democracy criticisms between out-parties.
